# cheque_generator

##################################

Programming language that is used to develop this project is C++............................................................

The main aim of this project is to make use of the file handling feature of C++ and develop a software product that can generate salary cheque of employees within an organisation.
There are four text files ....
1.ratecard.txt
2.userdesignation.txt
3.userid.txt
4.userpass.txt

These 4 files store the required records of each employee sequentially  and later the program fetch details from them to generate their salary.
 
 Currently cheque generated couldn't be saved, since project is in its initial stage later some ways of saving the cheque will be added soon.
